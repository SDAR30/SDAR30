### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Iâ€™m Shoaib Dar, a detail-oriented and analytical Full Stack Developer who loves to solve problems and puzzles. I enjoy reading, traveling, and learning about the world we live in, and have open-minded conversations with the people in it. Growing up, I have been helped immensely by my community through difficult times and I can't wait to start my career so I can repay back my community one day. I am currently in Pursuit's intensive 12-month long software engineering fellowship program, progressing through six modules:

## Module 1:  JavaScript

```javascript
const queue = (arr, item) => {
  arr.push(item);
  var removed = arr.shift();
  return removed; 
}
```

## Module 2: HTML & CSS
```
<body>
  <p> Hello World</p>
</body>
```
```
body{
display: flex;
justify-content: center;
}
```
