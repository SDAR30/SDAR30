### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Shoaib Dar, a detail-oriented and analytical Full Stack Developer with a passion for solving problems and puzzles. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, where I gained expertise in various areas, including artificial intelligence, data structures, and algorithms. And i recently completed an intensive 12-month software engineering fellowship program at Pursuit to further refine my skills.

Growing up, my community played a crucial role in helping me through difficult times, and I am now dedicated to giving back. In my free time, I enjoy reading books and engaging with other people to learn about the world and the people in it. Motivated by a passion for learning, I persistently strive to enhance both my personal and professional growth.
